<h3><strong>INTRODUCTION TO STUDY</strong></h3>
<H2>SOCIAL MEDIA</H2>
<P><em>Social media makes it easier for all of us to connect with our friends and family. People use several sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp and Pinterest. In Today's technological and cultural climate social media is been worshipped among everyone.
  The endless stream of communication and connection provided by social media is changing the way we think and absorb information. As it is, people are currently developing social media habits that can simultaneously benefit and harm their mental health.
  As use of social media continues to rise, it is estimated that by 2021, over 3 billion people will be using it (Clement, 2018).</em></P>
<h3><strong>What Is the Impact of Social Media on Mental Health of youth?</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p>Social media affects us mentally, physically and socially. Social media usage in particular has increased dramatically over the last decade and continues at an incline.  Research  links between body dissatisfaction and eating disorders with exposure to fashion posts shown on social media. This increase in usage of social media, especially Facebook and Instagram, may negatively affect adolescent girls and young women in regard to their self-confidence and body satisfaction. Social Media has made bullying and paedophilia has been increased as the social media has been used by everyone. The beauty standard is being anorexic and to look skinny which they have been wrongly influenced by social media and also tend to throw out food they have consumed to lose calories which causes depression and mood disturbance. Many people express rich moods and emotions in their social media posts. Psychologists use the word “affect” to describe these experiences of feelings and emotions. According to<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519398906658">(Gross et al., 1998)</a>and <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/07363760810845381/full/html?fullSc=1&mbSc=1&fullSc=1&fullSc=1&fullSc=1">(Silvera et al., 2008)</a>Affect plays an important role in cognition and well-being. Therefore, affective expressions in social media text have made inferences about users' personality traits or mental health. Passive usage of social media can foment envy and resentment, as well as anxiety-provoking Depression and anxiety have adverse consequences on adolescent development, including lower educational attainment, school dropout, impaired social relationships, and increased risk of substance abuse, mental health problems and suicide</p>

  <h3><strong>Suicidal thoughts due to Social Media</strong></h3>
  <p>Across the country, mental health experts are having to deal with an increase number of youths who are showing suicidal tendencies due to the adverse effect of depression caused by social media. According to 2020 therapists have observed an increase of 30% in clients who have self-harmed, as well as those who have expressed suicidal ideation or death wish. People are more into meeting the unrealistic standards by following famous celebrities and doing almost anything to meet their standards and failures in this are causing depressive thoughts in individuals which end up suicidal thoughts or death wishes.</p>

  <h2>Real Self and Ideal Self</h2>
  <h3>Introduction to Real self and Ideal Self</h3>
  <p>According to the Humanistic Psychologist Carl Rogers, the personality is composed of the Real Self and the Ideal Self. Your Real Self is who you actually are, while your Ideal Self is the person you want to be</p>
  <br>
  <p><i><strong>In psychology the real self and ideal self are used to describe the personality domain.</strong></i></p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/67/b4/7a67b470a14788ea6faa31fd07323f42.jpg" alt="real self">
    <li><Strong>REAL SELF</Strong></li>
      </ul>
  <P> The real self is who we actually are. It is how we think, how we feel, look, and act. The real self can be seen by others, but because we have no way of truly knowing how others view us, the real self is our self-image.</P>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IDEAL SELF</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Ideal self is how we want to be. It is an idealized image that we have developed over time, based on what we have learned and experienced. The ideal self could include components of what our parents have taught us, what we admire in others, what our society promotes, and what we think is in our best interest.</p>
  <p>Often while making plans for the success we consider only the ideal situation. “In 5 years, I will own a car and my own house” that is achievable but requires a hard work and firm determination. Reality is more stressful than the ideal situation of course. However, aiming for achieving an ideal goal for leading an ideal life (the way you imagined it) can be considered success, but not always</p>
    <p>Sometimes in order to achieve something we tend to always live life without being satisfied. Like, “I wish I could have done that”, “I should somehow do it” which creates a pressure on our shoulder and is really hard to manage a life with satisfaction especially if the ideal situation is deviation from the reality.</p>
    <p>Humanistic psychologist, Carl Rogers, believed that we all own a real self and an ideal self.  The real self of course is what we are intrinsically.  It`s the self that feels most true to what and who we really are; the honest self that leaves us most comfortable in our skin.  It may not be perfect, but it`s the part of us that feels most real.  And it`s the one we need to learn to love the most.</p>

  <p>These days as we all know Social media is surfacing all over the world.  experts worry that the social media and text messages that have become so integral to Youths life  that it is promoting anxiety and lowering their self-esteem. The survey results found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all led to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image and loneliness. Everyday chronic social media use may affect trait self-esteem negatively, they tend to have unrealistic beliefs which makes them isolated and depressed. Looking at the models or the successful people can sometimes lower the self esteem of young adults. Many questions can arise in their mind , like to which “Why have we not achieved this yet”?, “why does my body look so ugly”?, “Why am i not Pretty like them”?. All these negative thoughts can make their self esteem so low that can also lead to self harming thoughts.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Two recent studies have looked at the impact of chronic and temporary exposure to social comparison information on social media sites in terms of the impact on self-evaluations and self-esteem. The first study found that people who used Facebook most frequently, had lower trait self-esteem that those who used Facebook less or not at all.</p><br>
  <p>
    The second study examined the impact of temporary exposure to social networking sites on state self-esteem. The results show that participants experienced lower state self-esteem and poorer self-evaluations after exposure to a person with a high activity social network.</p>
